/**
 * Contract Purpose:
 * The MerkleAirdrop contract is designed to securely and efficiently distribute tokens to eligible users using Merkle proofs.
 * It ensures that only users who are included in a predefined Merkle Tree can claim their airdrop. This approach saves significant
 * storage and gas costs by not storing every eligible address on-chain. Instead, a Merkle root is stored and used for verification.

 * Key Features Used:
 * - Merkle Tree: Uses Merkle proofs to verify airdrop eligibility.
 * - Merkle Root Storage: Stores the root hash on-chain for future proof verification.
 * - Claim Tracking: A mapping is used to ensure each address can only claim once.
 * - Keccak256 Hashing: Provides cryptographic hashing for secure proof validation.
 * - Event Emission: Logs successful claims for transparency and potential auditing.

 * Technical Concepts Used:
 * - Merkle Proof Verification: Each user must present a valid proof path leading to the stored Merkle root.
 * - Gas Optimization Techniques: Minimal storage is used (only root and claim map), and memory variables are prioritized during execution.
 * - Mapping for Claim Status: Efficiently tracks which addresses have claimed, preventing double-spending.
 * - Read/Write Access Patterns: Uses `calldata` for input arrays to reduce gas consumption.
